This repository contains configurations for my apps and the [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org)
window manager with all it's plugins and ecosystem apps that I use.

Icons, themes and /etc/** related configurations are not in this repo (_yet_)

I might create setup scripts for myself and add to this repository in the near future _for personal use_.
Remember to update the configurations and settings for yourself and check if you have the dependencies installed on your system.
